  abstract  = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) covers a wide range of behavioral abnormality. There is an increase in the number of patients suffering from ASD. However, the researchers are yet to find any effective biomarker that can diagnose ASD accurately. The diagnosis process is still based on the interview and observation of the patients, which is at fault sometimes. In this study, we proposed a diagnosis process of ASD with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) model, where the structural (T1-weighted) images by magnetic resonance imaging are used. At first, we trained the CAE using only one type of subjects (either ASD or healthy control subjects). Then we used the CAE to reconstruct the images of both the types of subjects and measured the similarity between the input image and the reconstructed image. Finally, using the similarity metrics, we trained support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis for the diagnosis of ASD. Our proposed diagnosis framework achieved a classification accuracy of 96.2% for the entire autism brain imaging data exchange 1 dataset, which is better than any state-of-the-art studies.}
